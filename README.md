# CS50 TSE
## Cooper LaPorte (Dartcooper)

The assignment and Specs are in a [public repo](https://github.com/CS50winter2023/labs/tse).

There were no assumptions made while writing the tse, my implementation does not differ from the specs besides the ways noted in each individual module's README.md, and there are no ways I know of in which my implementation fails to work.

This project has parts to scan websites, index and store the information gathered, and take queries to find websites that contain words matching those in the given query.
